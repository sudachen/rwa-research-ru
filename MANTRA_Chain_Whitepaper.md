# MANTRA Chain - Purpose-Built RWA Layer 1

## Overview

MANTRA Chain is a modular Layer-1 blockchain engineered for decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, with a foundational commitment to regulatory compliance. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, MANTRA focuses on a specialized, high-value niche in the RWA space.

## Key Features

### Full EVM Compatibility

MANTRA Chain v5.0.0 (Abunnati Upgrade) introduced full EVM support:
- Deploy Solidity smart contracts using standard EVM tooling
- Use familiar development tools (Hardhat, Foundry, Remix)
- Leverage existing Ethereum libraries and frameworks
- No need to learn new languages or paradigms

### The Permissionless + Permissioned Advantage

MANTRA Chain uniquely supports both models:

**Compliance Features:**
- **KYC/KYB** - Know Your Customer / Know Your Business
- **KYT** - Know Your Transaction
- **KYV** - Know Your Validator (unique to MANTRA Chain)

**Benefits:**
- Institutional adoption for regulated entities
- Specialized RWA applications
- Hybrid ecosystems supporting both open DeFi and regulated tokenization

### Native Cross-Chain Interoperability

- Seamless asset transfers across different blockchains
- IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol support
- Optimized for cross-chain transactions

### High Performance & Low Costs

- Optimized for DeFi and RWA applications
- Fast transaction finality
- Low transaction fees
- Scalable architecture

### Flexible Infrastructure

- Supports both permissionless and permissioned use cases
- Modular design for various applications
- Compliance-ready without sacrificing developer freedom

## Technical Architecture

### Cosmos SDK Foundation

Built on Cosmos SDK with custom modules:
- **x/tax** - Tax-related operations
- Custom RWA-specific modules
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for governance

### Dual-Chain Design

1. **MANTRA Cosmos** - Native Cosmos SDK chain
2. **MANTRA EVM** - EVM-compatible execution layer

## OM Token

Native token of MANTRA Chain:
- Staking and governance
- Transaction fees
- Cross-chain operations
- Validator incentives

## Use Cases

### Real-World Asset Tokenization

1. **Real Estate** - Fractional property ownership
2. **Commodities** - Gold, silver, and other assets
3. **Securities** - Compliant security token offerings
4. **Art & Collectibles** - High-value asset tokenization

### DeFi Applications

1. **DEXs** - Decentralized exchanges
2. **Yield Vaults** - Yield-bearing products
3. **Lending Protocols** - Collateralized lending
4. **Stablecoins** - Asset-backed stablecoins
