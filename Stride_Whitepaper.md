# Stride - Multichain Liquid Staking Protocol

## Overview

Stride is a layer one blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK and connected with many other chains via the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Stride is purpose-built for a single function: cross-chain liquid staking.

## What is Stride

Stride is the leading liquid staking protocol for:
- Celestia (TIA)
- Osmosis (OSMO)
- dYdX (DYDX)
- Cosmos Hub (ATOM)
- 10+ other IBC-compatible blockchains

## Liquid Staking Explained

### The Problem with Traditional Staking

Staked tokens earn staking rewards, but the trade-off is:
- Tokens are locked while staked
- Cannot be transferred
- Cannot be sold
- Cannot be used in DeFi

### The Stride Solution

Liquid staking lets users earn staking rewards without locking tokens:
- Stake tokens and receive stTokens (e.g., stATOM, stTIA, stOSMO)
- stTokens represent your staked position
- Use stTokens in DeFi while earning staking rewards
- Transfer, sell, or use as collateral

## How Stride Works

### 1. Pooled Stake

Stride manages:
- Deposits from users
- Reinvestment of staking rewards
- Withdrawals and unbonding

### 2. stToken Issuance

When you stake with Stride:
- Receive liquid staked tokens (stTokens)
- Transfer your stake freely
- Use as collateral in lending protocols
- Sell on DEXs if needed

### 3. Validator Selection

- Stride selects validators to delegate stake to
- Diversified across multiple validators
- Optimized for security and returns
- Community governance over validator set

## Supported Assets

Stride provides liquid staking for IBC-compatible tokens:
- **TIA** - Celestia
- **ATOM** - Cosmos Hub
- **DYDX** - dYdX
- **OSMO** - Osmosis
- **STARS** - Stargaze
- **DYM** - Dymension

## Celestia Bridging Hub

In addition to liquid staking, Stride serves as a bridging hub for the Celestia rollup ecosystem:
- TIA can't be bridged from Celestia directly to rollups
- Bridged through Stride using Hyperlane deployment
- Connects the Celestia rollup ecosystem
- Any two rollups are just one hop apart
