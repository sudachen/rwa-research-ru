# Union - ZK-Powered Interoperability Protocol

## Overview

Union is a modular, next-generation interoperability protocol that extends the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to all of web3 using zero-knowledge cryptography. Union provides trust-minimized, consensus verification for cross-chain communication.

## Key Features

### ZK-Powered Consensus Verification

- **Zero-knowledge proofs** make consensus verification scalable, cost-efficient, and fast
- **Trust-minimized interoperability** between blockchains
- Extends IBC (the gold standard) to all of web3

### Core Technology

- **Consensus verification** unlocks trust-minimized interoperability
- **ZK cryptography** provides scalability and efficiency
- **IBC extension** to non-Cosmos chains including Ethereum and beyond

## Architecture

Union is designed as:
- Modular interoperability layer
- ZK-powered consensus verification system
- Universal bridge for blockchain ecosystems
- IBC-compatible protocol extension

## Who Union is Built For

1. **Developers** - Building cross-chain applications
2. **Protocols** - Seeking secure interoperability
3. **Users** - Requiring seamless cross-chain experiences

## Core Values

- **Trust-minimization** - Security through cryptographic proofs
- **Decentralization** - No centralized intermediaries
- **Scalability** - ZK proofs enable efficient verification
- **Universality** - Connect any blockchain ecosystem

## Use Cases

1. **Cross-chain asset transfers** - Move assets between any chains
2. **Cross-chain messaging** - Send data across blockchain boundaries
3. **Unified liquidity** - Access liquidity across multiple chains
4. **Interoperable applications** - Build apps that span multiple chains
