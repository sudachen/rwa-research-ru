# Namada - Multichain Asset-Agnostic Privacy

## About Namada

Namada is a data-protection blockchain using zero-knowledge proof technology. Namada's cryptographical features give users asset-agnostic, multichain data protection, and is being built by the Anoma foundation.

## Key Innovations

- Zcash-like shielded transfers for any assets (fungible and non-fungible)
- Rewards for keeping assets in the shielded set

## Overview of Features

- **Proof-of-Stake with governance** to secure and evolve Namada
- **Fast-finality BFT** with 4-second blocks
- **IBC connections** to chains that already speak IBC (all Cosmos chains)
- **Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP)** - Privacy-preserving transfers for any asset
- **Convert Circuit** - Shielded set rewards mechanism
- **Ledger application** - Hardware wallet support

## Protocol Architecture

Namada is a Proof-of-Stake Layer 1 blockchain protocol that provides:

- State transitions governed by validity predicates
- Protocol parameters defining rules of operation
- Full IBC protocol support for cross-chain communication
