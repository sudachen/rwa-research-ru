# Electron Labs - ZK Proof Aggregation Layer

## Overview

Electron Labs is a ZK proof aggregator that increases the scalability of L1 blockchains by optimizing the verification mechanism for zkDapps, zkRollups, and AI dApps, reducing verification costs by up to 95%.

## Quantum: Proof Aggregation for Ethereum

Quantum is Electron Labs' flagship product - a universal and cost-efficient proof aggregation layer for Ethereum and other blockchains.

## Key Problems Solved

### Verification Cost Reduction

ZK-enabled protocols face high verification costs on Ethereum. Electron Labs addresses this by:
- Aggregating multiple proofs into a single proof
- Reducing on-chain verification costs by 95%
- Making ZK applications economically viable

### Proving Scheme Flexibility

Current limitations:
- Certain proving schemes (like Groth16) are subsidized with precompiles
- Other schemes face higher verification costs
- Lack of flexibility hinders innovation

Electron Labs solution:
- Universal proof aggregation supporting multiple schemes
- Scheme-agnostic verification
- Enables protocols to choose optimal proving systems

## Technical Architecture

### Proof Lifecycle

1. **Individual Proofs** - Generated by zkDapps/zkRollups
2. **Reduction** - Each proof reduced to same type with keccak hash as public input
3. **Aggregation** - Variable number of reduced proofs verified in single circuit
4. **Batch Merkle Root** - Public input is superRoot of all aggregated proofs
5. **On-chain Verification** - Single verification for entire batch

### Supported Proving Schemes

- Groth16
- PLONK
- STARKs
- Custom schemes via Quantum SDK
